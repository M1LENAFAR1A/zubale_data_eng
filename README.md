# ðŸ“Š **Data Processing Project - Code Explanation**

## ðŸš€ **1. Purpose of the Code**

The goal of this project is to **efficiently process and analyze product and order data** using **Python and SQL**. The project is divided into three main parts:

- **Challenge_1.py**: Merges and consolidates data from `products.csv` and `orders.csv`.  
- **Challenge_2.py**: Converts prices from **BRL** to **USD** using an **API**.  
- **Challenge_3.ipynb**: Executes **SQL** queries to extract strategic insights.

## ðŸ”‘ **2. Using `config.json` for API Key Management**

The API key was stored in the `config.json` file to prevent sensitive information from being hardcoded into the scripts.  

**Example Structure:**  
```json
{
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
